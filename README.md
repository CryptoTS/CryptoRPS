## Setup local server via Python
Open up any terminal.
Check what version of Python you have by running:
```
python -V
```
If you don't have Python, install it at: https://www.python.org/downloads/

<br />

In command line, naviage to the location of the website's files. Then spin up a local server from that location:

<br />

If you have **Python 2.X** run the command:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8501
```

If you have **Python 3.X** run the command:
```
python -m http.server 8501
```
<br /><br />
You now have a local server running on port 8545. Go to http://localhost:8545/ to access local website.
